# 🚀 Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI Copilot for Iterative Software Development

**Version**: 1.0  
**Owner**: Product Leadership + AI Engineering Team  
**Last Updated**: 2025-04-05  
**Status**: Draft → Ready for Phase 1 Validation

---

## 1. Vision

Build an **AI Copilot system** that actively assists product and engineering teams throughout the software development lifecycle — from ideation to implementation — by retrieving, synthesizing, and generating context-aware, traceable, and auditable artifacts grounded in the organization’s evolving knowledge base.

---

## 2. Goals

- ✅ Reduce time spent on documentation drafting and decomposition by 40%
- ✅ Improve artifact consistency and traceability (PRD → Spec → Code)
- ✅ Minimize hallucination and misalignment via grounded, cited AI outputs
- ✅ Enable dynamic scope management with AI-assisted impact analysis
- ✅ Support iterative, feedback-driven development with AI memory and learning

## 3. Target Users

| Role                  | Use Case                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Product Owners        | Draft Phase 0 vision, generate/validate PRDs, manage feature backlog     |
| Product Managers      | Decompose features → user stories, ensure alignment with main PRD        |
| System Architects     | Document decisions, validate tech consistency, assess impact of changes |
| Software Engineers    | Generate Engineering Specs, scaffold code, write tests from specs       |
| QA / DevOps           | Auto-generate test plans, infra configs from context                    |
| AI Agents (Themselves)| Retrieve, critique, link, generate, and reflect on artifacts             |

## 4. Scope (Phase 1 MVP)

### In Scope

- Indexing and retrieval of Phase 0–2 documents (PRDs, ADRs, Feature Specs)
- AI-assisted drafting of:
  - Phase 0: Vision, Audience, Feature Set
  - Phase 1: Main PRD + Architecture Decisions
  - Phase 1.x: Feature-scoped PRDs (with traceability links)
  - Phase 2: User Stories + Engineering Specs
- Basic LangChain agent to navigate document graph
- Self-critique (Self-RAG) for AI-generated drafts
- Citation and source-linking in all outputs
- Integration with Confluence + GitHub (read/write)

### Out of Scope (Phase 1)

- Full code generation with testing
- Auto-deployment or CI/CD triggering
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Fine-tuning custom LLMs
- Multi-modal (image, diagram) support

## 5. Key Features

| Feature ID | Name                     | Description                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| F01        | Document Knowledge Graph | All artifacts indexed with bidirectional links (PRD ←→ Spec ←→ Story)       |
| F02        | Traceability Engine      | “Show me all user stories derived from Feature X” or “What PRD section justifies this API?” |
| F03        | AI Drafting Assistant    | Generates drafts for any phase with inline citations and revision suggestions |
| F04        | Self-Critique Mode       | AI critiques its own output: “Is this consistent with ADR #5? Retrieving...” |
| F05        | Query Expansion          | Rewrites vague queries: “auth flow” → “OAuth2 implementation in Phase 1 ADR” |
| F06        | Tool Integration         | Invokes GitHub (create issue), Confluence (save doc), Jira (log task)       |

## 6. Success Metrics

| Metric                          | Target (Phase 1) |
|---------------------------------|------------------|
| % of PRDs drafted with AI help  | ≥ 70%            |
| Avg. time saved per PRD         | ≥ 3 hours        |
| Traceability link accuracy      | ≥ 95%            |
| AI citation rate (outputs)      | 100%             |
| Hallucination rate (sampled)    | < 5%             |

## 7. Open Questions

- How do we handle conflicting versions of documents?
- Should AI suggest new features during iteration? If so, under what guardrails?
- What human-in-the-loop checkpoints are mandatory per phase?
- How do we measure “quality” of AI-generated Engineering Specs?
