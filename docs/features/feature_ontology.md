# Feature Spec — Ontology for Context Awareness & Governance

## Overview
This feature defines the ontology layer of the **AI Copilot** knowledge base. The ontology ensures that documents, artifacts, and relationships are consistently structured, governed, and interpretable across the iterative product and engineering workflow.

The ontology provides the **semantic backbone** for:
- Context-aware retrieval and reasoning.
- Governance of metadata, document lifecycle, and relationships.
- Alignment of all indexed knowledge into a traceable, queryable structure.

## Goals
- Define a **shared conceptual model** across PRDs, ADRs, user stories, specs, and implementations.
- Ensure **consistent metadata fields** (author, phase, status, dependencies).
- Support **graph-based reasoning** through explicit entity and relationship definitions.
- Provide **context-awareness** for retrieval (phase, document type, dependency).
- Enforce **governance policies** for document states, versioning, and traceability.

## Inputs
- Parsed nodes and metadata from the document parsing pipeline.
- Indexing outputs (nodes with relationships).
- Governance rules (e.g., approval workflows, document version lifecycle).

## Outputs
- **Ontology schema** capturing:
  - Document types (PRD, ADR, User Story, Spec, Code Component).
  - Relationships (depends_on, references, supersedes, authored_by).
  - Lifecycle states (draft, approved, deprecated).
- **Annotated nodes** enriched with ontology-aligned metadata and relationship labels.
- **Governance policies** embedded into the ontology (e.g., PRD must link to at least one ADR).

## Key Requirements
1. **Context Awareness**
   - Define semantic types for all documents and artifacts.
   - Capture hierarchical and cross-document relationships.
   - Support phase-aware queries (e.g., “show all ADRs linked to this Phase 1 PRD”).

2. **Metadata Standardization**
   - Normalize frontmatter fields across documents into ontology properties.
   - Ensure fields like `author`, `created_at`, `phase`, `tags` are consistent.

3. **Graph Schema**
   - Encode nodes and relationships into a coherent schema.
   - Allow traversal queries (dependencies, lineage, impact analysis).

4. **Governance & Compliance**
   - Enforce lifecycle states (draft → approved → deprecated).
   - Validate required relationships (e.g., every ADR links to a PRD).
   - Track provenance and version history.

5. **Extensibility**
   - Allow new document types and relationships without breaking existing schema.
   - Support optional custom taxonomies (e.g., business domains, system components).

## Non-Goals
- Defining the storage backend for the ontology (graph DB, index, etc.).
- Implementation of approval workflows (handled externally).
- Detailed query interface (covered under retrieval features).

## Dependencies
- Requires outputs from **Parsing** and **Indexing** features.
- Requires a governance process for document lifecycle rules.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Ontology schema defined and documented (entities, relationships, states).
- ✅ All indexed nodes enriched with ontology metadata and relationship labels.
- ✅ Retrieval can filter and reason using ontology (e.g., “show all approved ADRs for Feature X”).
- ✅ Governance rules enforceable at ingestion and query time.
- ✅ Schema extensible without disruption to existing knowledge base.
